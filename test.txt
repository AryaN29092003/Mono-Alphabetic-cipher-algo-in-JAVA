we are venom We come from a planet called klyntar
The planet is a exoplanet which left its orbit and travelled through different galaxies absorbing life force from various planets orbit and sustaining itself on the energy borrowed from different star along the way
The energies and life forces made the matter conscious and evolve into life forms called klyntars
 Just like our planet we klyntars survive using the energy of a host
  But we dont take it for free we only use  part of that energy and the remaining is used to heal or grow the host in ways not unlocked to the host
  Every now and then our host calls us a parasite but we are not parasite who suck life out of the host but give something back in return
We are Symbiotes
We are Venom
